# Python data structures


## Python built-in objects

| Object type        | Example                                           |
| ------------------ |:-------------------------------------------------:|
| Numbers            | 1, 234, 34135                                     |
| Strings            | "python", "word"                                  |
| Lists              | [], [1, 2, "string", [2],]                        |
| Dictionaries       | {"key" : "value" }, dict(monts=12)                |
| Tuples             | (1, 'spam', 4, 'U'), tuple('spam'), namedtuple    |
| Files              | open('config.txt'), open('/srv/data.json')        |
| Sets               | set('123'), {'dog', 'bone', 'cat'}                |
| Booleans           | True, False                                       |
| NoneType           | None                                              |

## Major types:

### Numbers 
Support addition, multiplication, etc.

Examples:
- integer
- floating-point
- decimal
- fraction

### Sequences 
Sequences support indexing, slicing, concatenation and more.

Examples:
- strings
- lists
- tuples


### Mappings 
Mappings support indexing by key.

Example:
 - dictionaries



## Mutable and immutable:

### Immutable:

The state of an immutable object cannot be changed after it is instantiated. In some cases, you might run an expression against an immutable object to create a new object with altered values.

Immutable object examples:
- numbers
- strings
- tuples
- frozensets.


### Mutable:

The state of mutable objects can be changed after they are instantiated. Mutable objects support in-place operations.

Mutable object examples:
- lists
- dictionaries
- sets
