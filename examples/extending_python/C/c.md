```
Python code is not compiled into machine-code. It is compiled into a special low-level intermediary language called bytecode that only CPython understands. This code is stored in .pyc files in a hidden directory and cached for execution. If you run the same Python application twice without changing the source code, itâ€™ll always be much faster the second time. This is because it loads the compiled bytecode and executes it directly.
```

Still faster then running the same app twice would be to have Python call functions that are compiled to machine code. You can use C, C++ or Rust to extend Python. This is about extending Python with C. Extending Python with Rust is described [here](http://saidvandeklundert.net/learn/2021-11-18-calling-rust-from-='[ython-using-pyo3/).


### Data types

`int`: variable that can be used to contain integral values only
`float`: numbers that contain decimal places
`double`: same as float but with roughly twice the precision. Used when the range of a float is not sufficient.

### Compiling

```
gcc 01.c
gcc -o 01.exe 01.c
```


For a shared lib with Python (programm is named `add.c`):
```
gcc -c -fpic add.c
gcc -shared -o libadd1.so add.o
```
### memory

`malloc`: allocate some memory

```c
b = (char *)malloc(size);
```

C does not include a garbage collector. You have to free the memory yourself using `free`:

```c
free(b);
```
