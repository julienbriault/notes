"""
Is it a thing? Then you can make that thing into a class. 
Otherwise, you can also consider a module with many functions.
--
If you are writing a lot of classes with 1 or 2 mtehods, consider using functions.

They are simpler and easier to test. Premature abstraction is often not a good thing.

Class method:
- use-case is for it to server as an alternate constructor
- A common naming convention for such methods is to include the word from_

Class attribute use-case:
- configuring the behavior of a class
- storing data that should be shared among all instances of a class


Basic strategies to consider (according to dabeaz): 
- writing classes with useful __repr__() methods
- preferring composition over inheritance
- allowing dependency injection

If you wish to have an even more private attribute, prefix the name with two leading underscores ( __ ).
All names such as __name are automatically renamed into a new name of the form _Classname__name.


Summary from dabeas
In the big picture, it's useful to step back and consider a few generally desirable code qualities.

First and foremost, readability counts for a lotâ€”and it often suffers if you pile on too many layers of abstraction. 

Second, you should try to make code that is easy to observe and debug, and don't forget about using the REPL.

Finally, making code testable is often a good driver for good design. 
If your code can't be tested or testing is too awkward, there may be a better way to organize your solution.
