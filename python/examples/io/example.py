"""
At the lowest level, communication with the outside world (outside of Python), is
 done through bytes and text.

The built-in 'bytes' and bytearray':
- bytes: an immutable sequence of integers values, ranging from 0 - 255. The bytes literal representation is ASCII text.
- bytearray: a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 - 255


- stdin: file object corresponding to the stream of input characters supplied to the interpreter.
- stdout: file object that is the interpreter's standard output stream in Python
- stderr: file object that is the interpreter's standard output stream for error messages
