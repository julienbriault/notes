```
Python code is not compiled into machine-code. It is compiled into a special low-level intermediary language called bytecode that only CPython understands. This code is stored in .pyc files in a hidden directory and cached for execution. If you run the same Python application twice without changing the source code, itâ€™ll always be much faster the second time. This is because it loads the compiled bytecode and executes it directly.
```

Still faster then running the same app twice would be to have Python call functions that are compiled to machine code. You can use C, C++ or Rust to extend Python. This is about extending Python with C. Extending Python with Rust is described [here](http://saidvandeklundert.net/learn/2021-11-18-calling-rust-from-='[ython-using-pyo3/).

Options to extend/speed up Python with C:
- using ctypes: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes
- cffi library: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Python API



### Compiling

```
gcc 01.c
gcc -o 01.exe 01.c
```


For a shared lib with Python (programm is named `add.c`):
```
gcc -c -fpic add.c
gcc -shared -o libadd1.so add.o
```


### Python API


At the top of the file, you need to pull in the Python API:

```python
#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include <Python.h>
```

On Windows, you will find an 'include' directory where Python is installed. On my system for instance, it was `C:\Python39\include`. On a Linux system, you might need to install the `python-dev` package.
