# Extending Python with C


https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/:
```
Python code is not compiled into machine-code. It is compiled into a special low-level intermediary language called bytecode that only CPython understands. This code is stored in .pyc files in a hidden directory and cached for execution. If you run the same Python application twice without changing the source code, itâ€™ll always be much faster the second time. This is because it loads the compiled bytecode and executes it directly.
```

Still faster then running the same app twice would be to have Python call functions that are compiled to machine code. You can use C, C++ or Rust to extend Python. This is about extending Python with C. Extending Python with Rust is described [here](http://saidvandeklundert.net/learn/2021-11-18-calling-rust-from-='[ython-using-pyo3/).

Options to extend/speed up Python with C:
- using ctypes: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes
- cffi library: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Python API: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html



# Using ctypes


When we use `ctypes`, we can write some C, compile it and then import the compiled C into our Python.

## A small example

An example would be the following C file called `square.c`:

```c
int square(int i)
{
    return i * i;
}
```

We can compile this file as follows:
```
gcc -shared -o clib.so square.c
```


This gives us a `clib.so` file that we can import into our Python script that could be as straightforward as the following code:

```python
import ctypes

c_lib = ctypes.CDLL("./clib.so")
x = c_lib.square(40)
print(x)
```


# Python API

The Python API is usable by C and C++. It is a maintained feature of Python and it is documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html). In case you want to have your C extensions added to Python, it is worth noting that you have to following [PEP 7](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/). It might also be worth knowing this PEP exists as it clarifies some of the existing C code.

## A small example

At the top of the file, you need to pull in the Python API:

```python
#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include <Python.h>
```

On Windows, you will find an 'include' directory where Python is installed. On my system for instance, it was `C:\Python39\include`. On a Linux system, you might need to install the `python-dev` package.


# Using the example extensions


There are several example extensions in this folder. Here is an example on how to install and run the `functions` example:

```
root@pyo3:/var/tmp/python/C/extend_python/python_api# pip install -e functions/src/
```

Most extension modules have an `example.py` and a `test.py` file that you can run:

```
root@pyo3:/var/tmp/python/C/extend_python/python_api# python3 functions/src/example.py 
Hello from C
root@pyo3:/var/tmp/python/C/extend_python/python_api# python3 functions/src/test.py    
Hello from C
```



# making an extension module:

Let's say the package is located in the `src/` directory. If it has the `setup.py` file, then the following will build and install the package:

```
pip install -e src/
```

When you run `python setup.py build`, the package will be built into a 'build' subdir and python will not import this file 'automatically' when it starts. 
# C modules:

```
Source files for standard library extension modules,
and former extension modules that are now builtin modules.
