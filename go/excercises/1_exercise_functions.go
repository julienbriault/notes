package main

// Define a func called insertComma that takes in a string and returns a string as well as an error
// if the input string is shorter then 3, return an error stating "string is too short"
// if the input string is longer, return the input string with a comma after the 3rd character

func main() {
	// run insertComma twice, catching the error if any and print the result to screen.
	// The first time you run the function, it should succeed. The second time it should fail.
